## Introduction
This automation system manages the end-to-end process of releasing albums on Spotify â€” from metadata entry and track uploads to launch scheduling and promotional sharing.  
It eliminates manual workflows and reduces publishing errors for artists, record labels, and marketers managing multiple releases.

### Automating Spotify Album Publishing
- Auto-fills album details (title, genre, release date, cover art).
- Uploads multiple tracks in sequence using human-like interaction.
- Connects with Spotify for Artists to verify and publish albums automatically.
- Monitors the upload and verifies track availability post-launch.
- Integrates promotional workflows such as playlist submissions or share automation.

## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The user schedules or uploads album data through the Appilot dashboard, including track files, album title, and artwork.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot connects to the device/emulator via UI Automator or Appium to open Spotify for Artists, fill data, upload tracks, and configure release details.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” The bot confirms submission, verifies uploaded albums, and logs the Spotify release link.  
4. **Other Functionalities** â€” Error recovery, album verification, and automated promotion via connected Spotify playlist bots.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python, Kotlin, Java  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, ADB, Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, Accessibility Service  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel execution, Task queues
